# Syslog Monitor

This is a web based application to monitor the realtime syslogs generated by devices.
It will display the warnings/errors/exception etc occuring along with the actual logs
at a selected point of time. The intuitive UI helps user to get a quick look at the
stats about the errors so corrective actions can be taken on time. The database at
the backend keeps storing all the logs for verification at later stage.
